# RockPaperScissor

https://sulflower.github.io/RockPaperScissor/
A web game that I created to practice JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
This is a game where you play against a computer in a best of 5 rounds.

Learning outcomes:
- Built a web app with backend logic (rock, paper, scissors alrgorithm)
- CSS animations
- Showing/Hiding divs and updating elements using JavaScript
